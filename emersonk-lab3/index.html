            <!--bio-->
            <p id="intro">My name is Emma Kim and I am a daughter, sister, friend, athlete, and student at Carnegie Mellon University. I play on the womenâ€™s soccer team at CMU and spend the majority of my time playing soccer when I am not studying. My family and friends are very important to me, and spending whatever remaining time I have with them is a priority for me.   I grew up in Seattle, Washington so I love nature whether that is taking a hike, running around a lake or going out on the water. I also love music- whether that is current edm or 90s throwbacks. I enjoy talking about music with my friends and family and love discovering new artists. I am an Information Systems major, and I intend to minor in AI. I enjoy learning about the technical world along with understanding data and its effect on businesses.</p>
